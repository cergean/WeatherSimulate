# WeatherSimulate
Provides a mechanism to generate weather parameters, such as temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, and so on.
Basic purpose of this is weather conditions for weather-dependant games, so atmost it will have nothing to do with
real weather, but it will try to generate weather conditions as similar to real, as it can be for 365-day year.
wish me luck.
